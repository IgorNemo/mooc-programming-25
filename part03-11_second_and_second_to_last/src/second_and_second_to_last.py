# Solution from the site:

# word = input("Please type in a string: ")
 
# # Check also that the word is at least two characters long,
# # so that the second and second to last characters exist
# if len(word) > 1 and word[1] == word[-2]:
#     print("The second and the second to last characters are " + word[1])
# else:
#     print("The second and the second to last characters are different")
